# HTML Parser

Created a parser to help create a table of contents for articles and publish them on HashNode.

You give it string of html and it will retrieve all the headings from the html string.

Then console.log the title of the heading along with the id in markdown syntax so that I can easily paste it on a markdown file. I print out the tag so to follow along the heading hierarchy
